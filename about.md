# About Me

**Office**: KAIST Urban Robotics Lab ([URL](http://urobot.kaist.ac.kr/))  
**E-mail**: dongukseo@kaist.ac.kr    
    


My research interests lie in LiDAR-Camera fusion based SLAM for robust long-term autonomy.
Also, the process collaborated with multi-agent and localization in the dense map representation are of my interests.
Iâ€™m mainly focusing on the Visual SLAM, but also trying to use LiDAR.     


<!--* <span style="color:black">**Visual SLAM**</span> for AR application. -->
* LiDAR-Visual-Inertial SLAM framework.
* Multi-Map reconstruction.
* Long-term autonomy.
